# Saku

## Concept

Saku is a personal cms that let you post things on the internet under your control. Saku wants to support the [indieweb](//indieweb.org) philosophy while as closely as possible.

## Getting started

If you want to test out Saku, you only need to clone this repo, make sure you have node and sqlite installed, and type `npm install`.

You can then run a test version with `npm run serve`
